# Snake-Keziah_Tabassomi-CDOF2
You know the game.

However, here we have implemented a simple game of snake which, when we run snake.py opens a new window and lets the user play the game.
Don't pay attention to the game of life, which has been discarded.
In order to run the project, you need to clone the repo on your computer and run the code in your IDE.

Feel free to contribute if you think of improvements to add, here's a list of what I would like to add soon:
  
  -Borders on the walls
  -the possibility to choose the color at the beginning
  -the option to pause a game
  
these are not the only improvements that can be made feel free to add any that you feel justified
